"""The calls every surface makes (HTTP routes in mcp_server/submission_routes.py, the MCP tools in server.py, the CLI),
so they cannot drift. Each returns plain JSON; a SubmissionError / RunError / LookupError message is what the person
reads.

Review runs right after a submit or a fix. It is awaited up to `wait` seconds; past that it keeps running in the
background and the answer says the steps are still `reviewing` (ask for the submission again).
